          <h2>Project requirements:</h2>
          <p>must use 3D printing,Laser cutting and an arduino board</p>
          <h2>What is the project going to be?</h2>
          <p>The final year project ive decided to embark on is an RC Tank that uses an arduino board. The reason why i picked an RC tank is because it will act as a test bed for mechincally based systems
              like suspension, transmition and other experiments, maybe even electrical. It will help me with future projects be it upscaled or downscaled plus it will expand my knowledge of the RC and mechincal world.
          </p>

        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>The final project is due within the next 4 weeks of our school curriculum and i have already prepped for the final project by purchasing the electronics 2 weeks before hand which all have arrived this week. My project's code and electronics
            will be based on an existing project done by a youtuber called Teaching Tech. This is his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSH3wM5euVE&t </p>
        <p>For This project there will be several sections of the build that will be considered to be the main modular set up. This consists of 1. Main body platform. 2.Housing of electrical components and receiver 3.suspension system.
        </p>
        <h2>Main body platform contents:</h2>
        <p id=p1 >1. Sheet of laser cut out plywood.</p>    
           <p id=p1> 2. Housing for 12v motors.</p>
        <h2>Housing of electrical components contents:</h2>
        <p id=p1>1. Arduino Uno </p>
        <p id=p1>2. 14.8v 15000MAH Li-Po battery  </p>
        <p id=p1>3. 5v 12v power converter</p>
        <p id=p1>4. RC Flysky FS-R6B  recevier </p>
        <p id=p1>5. Jumper cables and wires   </p>
        <p id=p1>6. Drive motor shield for Ardunio uno </p>
        <h2>Suspension system contents and control surface: </h2>
        <p id=p1>1. 3D printed road wheels, sprocket and tracks that use m3 screws as links. </p>
        <p id=p1>2. Laser cut side panel for mounting suspension </p>
        <p id=p1>3. Suspension system using rubber bands as springs </p>
        <p id=p1>4. RC FlySky FS-CT6B remote controller </p>
        <p id=p1> </p>
        <h3>Designing the main body;</h3>
        <p>Before I had enetered the course i had actually designed and modeled serveral of my tanks and therefore i thought i could use the research and development used for my final product as shown here.</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/847545019723808788/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:200px;height:110px"/></p>
        <p>
            As the days went and i started to buy and recevie the parts needed for this project i started to think perhaps my model might not fit all the components within a reasonable size just yet which is actually an issue which 
            tank designers have been facing since the dawn of tanks till this very day. The designs now focus on the practicality side of things like layout of components and technologies therefore i have proceded with that approach too by
            starting from the ground up by how the body and layout should be structured with a more "boxy" approach to simplify the design which has led me to make a cardbaord reference piece using scrap from the fablab.  
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/868615397245603850/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:600px;height:90px"/></p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/868616727657869332/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:400px;height:110px"/></p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/867990293260173332/image2.jpg" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:200px;height:120px"/>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/867990292274499604/image0.jpg" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:200px;height:120px"/>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/867990292903632937/image1.jpg" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:200px;height:120px"/></p>
        <p>
            And so i went on to design the new model using the cardboard piece as dimensional and layout reference and this time i will be making the detailed version with the outer most dimensions of the compnoents translated
            into block/over simplified forms just without the rubber bands. Though
