         <p>My documentation of the whole journey from start to finish:</p>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>The final project is due within the next 4 weeks of our school curriculum and i have already prepped for the final project by purchasing the electronics 2 weeks before hand which all have arrived this week. My project's code and electronics
            will be based on an existing project done by a youtuber called Teaching Tech. This is his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSH3wM5euVE&t </p>

        <h3>Designing the main body;</h3>
        <p>Before I had enetered the course i had actually designed and modeled serveral of my tanks and therefore i thought i could use the research and development used for my final product as shown here.</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/847545019723808788/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:200px;height:110px"/></p>
        <p>
            As the days went and i started to buy and recevie the parts needed for this project i started to think perhaps my model might not fit all the components within a reasonable size just yet which is actually an issue which 
            tank designers have been facing since the dawn of tanks till this very day. The designs now focus on the practicality side of things like layout of components and technologies therefore i have proceded with that approach too by
            starting from the ground up by how the body and layout should be structured with a more "boxy" approach to simplify the design which has led me to make a cardbaord reference piece using scrap from the fablab.  
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/868615397245603850/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:600px;height:90px"/></p>

        <p>
            And so i went on to design the new model using the cardboard piece as dimensional and layout reference and this time i will be making the detailed version with the outer most dimensions of the compnoents translated
            into block/over simplified forms just without the rubber bands. Though i have started designing the tank in TinkerCAD which looks like this: 
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/872514286168199208/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:400px;height:240px"/>*Note:this is version to help me visiualise and understand what is needed for the last prototype.</p>
        <h3>Week 1.5</h3>
        <p> for the sake of production and print time i hade made a new print profile on cura for my ender 3 that focuses more on a fast functional print rather than something that took too long to produce and was not practical for its purpose in case any parts broke or needed to be changed.
         these are the profiles        </p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week i had begun production and fabrication of the materials starting with suspension. the overall process took me 6 days to print out everything along with spare parts and just took me 1 hour to assemble everything, although
            i did have to remake and redesign some of the parts to allow for intermeshing to occur properly. in the end it was all well and good but one major issue was the back strut, it had constrained the rear suspension from moving or functioning
            properly and thus caused a sloped back on the tank.</p>
            <p> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/873993043894755428/unknown.png" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:260px;height:180px"/></p> 
            <p>i have decided to remove it and has improved the sloped back issue but it is still there but most likely due to the motors being too heavy and thus causing some slope. other wise its fine.</p>
              <p>however after assembling the whole thing i noticed that the motor placements and the runnig gear were clashing with the main body of the tank that was laser cut. i tried to redesign a new motor mount/bracket around the main chasis 
                  </p> <p>
                    <p> <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/581934624368885763/874000351840317440/unknown.png?width=1088&height=702" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:260px;height:180px"/> (left:old, right:new)</p>
                  <p>but decided to just invert the mounts onto 
            the top side of the chasis to save time on development of a new mount and printing time which amounted to this: 
            <p> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/874010850330042378/image0.jpg" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:260px;height:180px"/></p>
            <p> After assembling the main body and all the mechanical components i added in the electrical items which consists of the 1.5A 14.8v LiPo battery, BEC, Adruino uno and motor shield.</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/874016282020831312/image0.jpg" alt="SP Fab Lab" style= "width:260px;height:180px"/></p> 
            <h2>Week3 </h2>
            <p>This week i have started on programming and getting the arduino to work with the RC set however i have met several challenges along the way.</p>
            <p>I am follwing closely to "teaching tech"'s code provided and all seems to be going well. In his video he had adapted his code to
                have servos on his tank but here i have removed them as my tank is not inented to have servos but in the future if they are needed i can easily add them back.  </p>
<h3>Week 3.5</h3>
<p>After wiring up and coding everything i ran into several issues. regarding the electronics of the tank mainly in the motor where by they wouldnt move and they would make a humming sound when given an input by
    the receiver. i had assumed it was the code and consulted many individuals with experience in arduino coding but to no avail.
</p>
<p>insert video here</p>
<h3>week4 </h3>
<p> when this week came about i had recieved help from a teacher and intern to test out the motors on the Power Supply Units in school to determine if they were working or not, unfortunately after some testing they werent working. as a result a teacher had allowed
    me to scavange for some continous stepper motors from previous builds and take them home to continue production/fabrication. 
    As soon as i had gotten home i went on to desing a new motor bracket and add some left over track links to accomodate for the extra space needed to mount the new motors as the previous bracket was just a bit too small.
