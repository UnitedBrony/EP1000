        <h2>Designing the main body:</h2>
        <p>Before I had entered the course i had actually designed and modeled serveral of my tanks and therefore I
            thought I could use the research and development used for my final product as shown here.</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/847545019723808788/unknown.png"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:200px;height:110px" /></p>
        <p>
            As the days went and I started to buy and recevie the parts needed for this project I started to think
            perhaps my model might not fit all the components within a reasonable size just yet which is actually an
            issue which
            tank designers have been facing since the dawn of tanks till this very day. The designs now focuses on the
            practicality side of things like layout of components and technologies therefore I have proceded with that
            approach too by
            starting from the ground up by how the body and layout should be structured with a more "boxy" approach to
            simplify the design which has led me to make a cardbaord reference piece using scrap from the fablab.
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/868616727657869332/unknown.png"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:400px;height:110px" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/867990293260173332/image2.jpg"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:200px;height:120px" />
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/867990292274499604/image0.jpg"

        </p>
        <p>
            And so I went on to design the new model using the cardboard piece as dimensional and layout reference and
            this time I will be making the detailed version with the outer most dimensions of the components translated
            into block/over simplified forms just without the rubber bands. Though I have started designing the tank in
            TinkerCAD which looks like this:
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/872514286168199208/unknown.png"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:400px;height:240px" />*Note:this version is to help me visualise and
            understand what is needed for the last prototype.</p>
        <h3>Week 1.5</h3>
        <p> for the sake of production and print time, I have made a new print profile on cura for my ender 3 that
            focuses more on a fast functional print rather than something that took too long to produce and was not
            practical for its purpose in case any parts broke or needed to be changed.
            these are the profiles </p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week I had begun production and fabrication of the materials starting with suspension. the overall
            process took me 6 days to print out everything along with spare parts and just took me 1 hour to assemble
            everything, although
            I did have to remake and redesign some of the parts to allow for intermeshing to occur properly. In the end
            it was all well and good but one major issue was the back strut, it had constrained the rear suspension from
            moving or functioning properly and thus caused a sloped back on the tank.</p>
        <p> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/873993043894755428/unknown.png"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:260px;height:180px" /></p>
        <p>I have decided to remove it and have improved the sloped back issue but it is still there but most likely due
            to the motors being too heavy and thus causing some slope. other wise its fine.<br>

            however after assembling the whole thing, I noticed that the motor placements and the runnig gear were
            clashing with the main body of the tank that was laser cut. I tried to redesign a new motor mount/bracket
            around the main chasis
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/581934624368885763/874000351840317440/unknown.png?width=1088&height=702"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:260px;height:180px" /> (left:old, right:new)
        </p>

        <p>
            But decided to just invert the mounts onto
            the top side of the chasis to save time on development of a new mount and printing time which amounted to
            this:
        </p>

                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:260px;height:180px" />
        </p>
        <p> After assembling the main body and all the mechanical components, I added in the electrical items which
            consists of the 1.5A 14.8v LiPo battery, BEC, Adruino uno and motor shield.</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581934624368885763/874016282020831312/image0.jpg"
                alt="SP Fab Lab" style="width:260px;height:180px" /></p>
                <h2>Week3 </h2>
                <p>This week I have started on programming and getting the arduino to work with the RC set. However, I have met
                    several challenges along the way.<br>
                    I am follwing closely to "teaching tech"'s code provided and all seems to be going well. In his video he had
                    adapted his code to
                    have servos on his tank but here I have removed them as my tank is not intented to have servos but in the
                    future if they are needed I can easily add them back. </p>
                    <h3>Week 3.5</h3>
                    <p>After wiring up and coding everything, I ran into several issues. Regarding the electronics of the tank
                        mainly
                        in the motor where by they wouldn't move and they would make a humming sound when given an input by
                        the receiver. I had assumed it was the code and consulted many individuals with experience in arduino coding
                        but to no avail.

        <h2>Week 4:</h2>
        <p> When this week came about I had received help from a teacher and an intern to test out the motors on the
            Power
            Supply Units in school to determine if they were working or not, unfortunately after some testing they
            weren't working. as a result a teacher had allowed
            me to scavange for some continous stepper motors from previous builds and take them home to continue
            production/fabrication.
            As soon as I had gotten home, I went on to design a new motor bracket and added some leftover track links to
            accommodate for the extra space needed to mount the new motors as the previous bracket was just a bit too
            small.

        <h2>Week 5:</h2>
        <p>Week 5 in fabricating this tank had been halted so that I may take the time to study for my upcoming exams.
            After my first exam I had taken a bit of time to continue working on my tank but came to the realisation
            that my RC transmitter and Li-Po battery had spoilt
            as the battery was puffed up and the transmitter was not lighting up as it should. What was made worse was
            the fact that my replacement transmitter had also spoilt due to my mistake of attaching 12v into it when it
            was supposed to take 5v.
            Following these unfortunate events my BEC broke at the contact point that outputs the 12v to the motorshield. This mean I couldn't power the 2 continuous stepper motors I had gotten from the teacher. 
            Despite this I couldn't do anything about it as my exams started to come closer. </p>

                    <h2>Week 6:</h2>
                    <p>After my second exam, I had sought help from a hobbist shop that specialised in RC components to see what could be done. The people there had helped me revamp my whole electrical system. A new type of BEC was picked to replace old BEC.
                        a new transmitter was issued along with a power distruber and a pair of 12v continous. To replace my battery they had also given me a Li-ion battery with a switch.

        <h2>Week 7:</h2>
        <p>Once we had done all the electrical wiring it was time for the coding part. Admittedly i was not very fluent in it but was able to complete it with their help and now the tank runs like a charm. unfortunately we werent able to use the 
            RC controller due to the receiver not being used here so we had to use a simple 2.4ghz controller with 4 push button inputs but was nontheless able to move the tank in all directions. A(backwards), B(forwards), C(left) and D(right).
